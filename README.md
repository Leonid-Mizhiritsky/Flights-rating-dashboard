## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance and trends of British Airways flight ratings from 2016 to 2023, with the goal of uncovering patterns, generating data-driven insights, and offering informed recommendations for a deeper understanding of flight comfort.

## Data Source
The main datasets for this analysis are the 'ba_reviews' file and the 'Countries' file. The former includes detailed information on British Airways reviews and ratings across various flight attributes, while the latter provides information about the locations of those reviews and other key details.

the datasets files can be downloaded here - [Reviews and Ratings Data](./ba_reviews.csv) and [Countries Data](./Countries.csv)

## Results and Findings
For example: If you look at the food ratings on British Airways flights, youâ€™ll notice that passengers from the USA were generally not satisfied, giving an average score of 2.6 out of 5 based on 116 reviews. Overall, food ratings remained relatively consistent between 2016 and 2023, except for a noticeable dip in the first half of 2020, likely due to the impact of COVID-19. In my opinion, the food quality could definitely use an upgrade. Interestingly, the best-rated food was on the Boeing 787 aircraft, with an average score of 3 out of 5 based on 52 reviews and A319 aircraft got an average score of 1.6 out of 5 based on 66 reviews. It must be further investigated.
